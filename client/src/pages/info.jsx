            This is a collection of AI generated images created using the DALL-E model. DALL-E is an AI model developed
            by Mira Murati at OpenAI and released in 2021. Its a OpenAi GPT-3 model trained on the image dataset from
            ImageNet.

            The model is known for its ability to generate realistic images and objects based on a text description,
            such as "a green bird with a crown on its head playing the piano with the feet". 12 billion parameters were
            used to train the model, which is 10 times more than the GPT-3 model.
